## Project: Be the Hero (Web and Mobile)

### Descriptive: An application web and mobile which the user can register an incident involving a dog, a cat, or any animal who needs help, like a temporary home, money for food, medicine, or a new family.

Also, there are shortcuts to contact by WhatsApp, e-mail, and details about the incidents.

Building the Application, day by day:

Day 1: Backend

Tools and Resources used in the Backend:

- NodeJs (The javascript resource)
- Express (Mini framework)
- React-Router-Dom (To track Routes)
- Knex ( To manipulate the Database )
- Nodemon (To follow changes and update the application)
- Insomnia (To validate the requests HTTP)
- CORS (To insert a security layer)

Obs: IDE Visual Studio Code

Step by Step (Building the application from start):

Terminal (inside the project folder):

\$ mkdir backend

\$ npm init-y

\$ cd backend

\$ npm install express

---

Add a index.js containing:

_const express = require('express');_

_const app = express( );_

_app.get('/', (request, response) => {_

_return response.json({_

_event: "Semana Omnistack",_

_user: "Fernando Lima"_

_})_

_})_

_app.listen(3333)_

â‡’ at the terminal : node index.js

Put the server up again and check the response.

---

**Day 2: Backend**

At this point Insomnia will be useful for testing requests

**Methods:**

- Get: get a info
- Post: Create a info
- Put: Edit a info
- Delete: Delete a info

**Types of parameters**

Query Params: parameters sent using the route (named), after "?" , they are

used mainly for filters and pagination. To access you ask for

const params = request.query

You will get the info from the request (named params, name, page, etc)

Route Params: to identify resources, a ID for example users/1093

_const params = request.params_

Request Body: Body of requisition, in a form : name, age, email...

_const body = request.body_

After the method , you need to inform the route and the resource

(route is the full path), and the resource is for example /users /contact

---

Note:

You need to inform to express that you are going to use JSON in the requisitions, otherwise always will return undefined

So, at the beginning of index (Before routes) :

_app.use( express.json( ) );_

---

**Nodemon:**

\$ npm install nodemon -D

In the package.json rewrite the script "test" to "start"

_"scripts": {_

_"start": "nodemon index.js"_

_},_

Put down the server and Put Up again using **npm start**

---

About the **Database**, in this project we will run SQL and using a QueryBuilder called **Knex**. ([http://knexjs.org/](http://knexjs.org/))\$ npm install knex

\$ npm install sqlite3

\$ npx knex init

A file called knexfile.js will be added in your project

Go to this file, there are some configs for different Databases.

Add a folder called src (folder will keep the structure)

Add a file called routes (Keep routes and methods)

_const express = require('express');_

_const routes = express.Router();_

obs: the _app.get_ change to _routes.get(...)_

_module.exports = routes;_

Sure that you have to import routes in the index.js

Change the path in the package.json for nodemon to src/index.js

Add a folder inside SRC named database

Change in knexfile.js as follow:

_development: {_

_client: 'sqlite3',_

_connection: {_

_filename: './src/database/db.sqlite'}_

_},_

Now, considering that we have the wireframes and prototypes of the interface as below:

Who are the entities to be created at DB?

Ongs

Incidents

What are the functionalities?

Ong Register / User Register

Login / Logout - ONG

Register of Incidents (New Incidents)

Delete Incidents

List of incidents in General

List of Incidents of Ong's Incidents

Get in Contact - Email

Get in Contact - WhatsApp

---

Creating Tables using Knex - Migration

Add a folder named migrations in the database folder

Inform to your knexfile.js :

_filename: './src/database/db.sqlite'_

_},_

_migrations:{_

_directory: './src/database/migrations_'

_}_

[http://knexjs.org/#Migrations-CLI](http://knexjs.org/#Migrations-CLI)

\$ npx _knex migrate:make create_ongs_

attention: this create the migration, so use a name related to a migration. what is it doing?

If you want , remove warning at the console using useNullAsDefault: true at knexfile after migrations.

Go to the file created (related migration) and set up the table.

_exports_.up = function.createTable(knex) {

return knex.schema.createTable('ongs', function(table){

table.string('id').primary();

table.string('name').notNullable();

table.string('email').notNullable();

table.string('whatsapp').notNullable();

table.string('city').notNullable();

table.string('whatsapp').notNullable();

table.string('uf', 2).notNullable();

});

};

The method down is used to drop in case of trouble.

_exports.down = function(knex) {_

_return knex.schema.dropTable('ongs');_

_};_

\$ npx knex migrate:latest

**Do the same with incidents!**

\$ npx knex migrate:make create_incidents

_exports_.up = function (knex) {

return knex.schema('incidents', function (table) {

table.increments();

table.string('title').notNullable();

table.string('description').notNullable();

table.decimal('value').notNullable();

table.string('ong_id').notNullable();

table.foreign('ong_id').references('id').inTable('ongs');

});

};

_exports_.down = function (knex) {

return knex.schema.dropTable('incidents');

};

\$ npx knex migrate:latest

If you want to undo :

\$ npx knex

\$ npx knex migrate:rollback

\*\*\* Will dismiss the last migration

To check the all migrations executed:

\$ npx knex migrate:status

\*\*\*In case of error, just delete dl.sqlite check the file which we create data.

and repeat the commmand knex latest ...

---

Go to Insonmia, add routes in a new Workspace.

And in the routes.js

**Updating the Structure**

Add folder controllers in src

The methods will be there, store, update, delete, index,

continue...
